00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.229
If we want to live well both externally and internally, how

5f70ab41-ca23-427c-8a2d-9c731b13de20-1
00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:12.001
well we live here simply depends on how well we manage our

5f70ab41-ca23-427c-8a2d-9c731b13de20-2
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:16.600
surroundings and how well we manage ourselves.

2b460122-46e6-45e4-885a-ce82e63070d9-0
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.520
Fundamentally, life is management.

17cd0023-48f1-4032-9859-f8f161c9a4ef-0
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.512
If you don't know how to maintain your body, your mind,

17cd0023-48f1-4032-9859-f8f161c9a4ef-1
00:00:26.512 --> 00:00:31.577
your emotion, your situations, your life in general, your home,

17cd0023-48f1-4032-9859-f8f161c9a4ef-2
00:00:31.577 --> 00:00:36.326
your communities, nations and the world, the quality of our

17cd0023-48f1-4032-9859-f8f161c9a4ef-3
00:00:36.326 --> 00:00:40.680
life is just how well we manage things with ourselves.

849d072a-05d8-4993-a512-f658c781a6ef-0
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.960
But generally we are thinking of management.

a997911a-84d5-4d54-8950-98a80d93dae2-0
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.272
We are applying ourselves to management only in terms of

a997911a-84d5-4d54-8950-98a80d93dae2-1
00:00:52.272 --> 00:00:56.861
business management or industry management or generally we are

a997911a-84d5-4d54-8950-98a80d93dae2-2
00:00:56.861 --> 00:01:01.377
talking management only with economic situations, not life as

a997911a-84d5-4d54-8950-98a80d93dae2-3
00:01:01.377 --> 00:01:01.959
a whole.

a1d4314a-8c4b-403f-8f91-d725411b06e7-0
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.866
In many ways, it's unfortunate that today the most predominant

a1d4314a-8c4b-403f-8f91-d725411b06e7-1
00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:15.000
factor that rules the planet has become economics.

af3ba037-cb76-4caf-9413-595d5fa03f4f-0
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.116
The other aspects of life have been totally pushed to the

af3ba037-cb76-4caf-9413-595d5fa03f4f-1
00:01:20.116 --> 00:01:20.560
corner.

8c813af5-024e-40ef-810a-c6c7fcbf342f-0
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.916
When economics rules sadhguru and economics is the only thing

8c813af5-024e-40ef-810a-c6c7fcbf342f-1
00:01:26.916 --> 00:01:31.713
that we are thinking about, we will tend to become very gross

8c813af5-024e-40ef-810a-c6c7fcbf342f-2
00:01:31.713 --> 00:01:33.880
and unhappy in so many ways.

eb08d46d-8204-4015-b553-154891c76f0b-0
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.712
What I see is, you know, we are conducting various levels of

eb08d46d-8204-4015-b553-154891c76f0b-1
00:01:40.712 --> 00:01:45.296
programs to very top level executives in some big

eb08d46d-8204-4015-b553-154891c76f0b-2
00:01:45.296 --> 00:01:50.797
corporations in the world, major, major corporations in the

eb08d46d-8204-4015-b553-154891c76f0b-3
00:01:50.797 --> 00:01:56.572
world, Sadhguru, what I see is people who have failed in their

eb08d46d-8204-4015-b553-154891c76f0b-4
00:01:56.572 --> 00:02:00.240
lives, they're suffering their failure.

26eb599d-5a10-4bdb-b579-11d8a19de63a-0
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.192
People who have succeeded in their life, they're suffering

26eb599d-5a10-4bdb-b579-11d8a19de63a-1
00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:05.960
their success.

10a110f5-9215-4bb9-8390-f95f29e9aa02-0
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.400
If you suffer your failure, it's
OK because failure comes easy.

62ba8be4-3418-4ee5-8e8e-5c1f2deb4608-0
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.873
If you suffer your success, that is tragedy because success

62ba8be4-3418-4ee5-8e8e-5c1f2deb4608-1
00:02:18.873 --> 00:02:20.120
doesn't come easy.

eb6f1f8e-af26-4552-afb5-80e88d62b815-0
00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.182
So something that you worked for, something that you always

eb6f1f8e-af26-4552-afb5-80e88d62b815-1
00:02:26.182 --> 00:02:29.720
longed for, something that you wanted to create in your life.

f538f404-c0b3-47c5-a76e-ed7efd714ecc-0
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.328
When it happens, if you start suffering that, that's real

f538f404-c0b3-47c5-a76e-ed7efd714ecc-1
00:02:34.328 --> 00:02:35.600
tragedy of life.

220697f1-fe95-4596-9930-8f5375dcfc90-0
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.786
But a large number of successful people on the planet are

220697f1-fe95-4596-9930-8f5375dcfc90-1
00:02:40.786 --> 00:02:42.320
suffering their success.

9bd12e5c-2f92-4e49-a4f4-cbb8f94269d7-0
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.596
When I say suffering their success, if you look at people,

9bd12e5c-2f92-4e49-a4f4-cbb8f94269d7-1
00:02:48.596 --> 00:02:53.721
sadhguru, look at yourself and see you're still young people,

9bd12e5c-2f92-4e49-a4f4-cbb8f94269d7-2
00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:58.845
most of you when you're five years of age, how happy you were

9bd12e5c-2f92-4e49-a4f4-cbb8f94269d7-3
00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:01.160
and today how happy you are.

59ebcb24-6ac9-4f06-ab4a-dd83bc895563-0
00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.770
If we make a chart out of it, a graph out of it, is it moving

59ebcb24-6ac9-4f06-ab4a-dd83bc895563-1
00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.000
upward or downward in 24 hours time?

b312ae0c-6678-4c4e-ae1d-1b3cecdc11b7-0
00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.400
How many moments are you really happy?

ff8645da-60f4-4ff2-a720-f7c8ec2aa5d5-0
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.240
If you look at this, is it going up or down?

cbb55d2e-2391-44a3-9dfa-9703c7f4441e-0
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.480
Hmm.

49eccd75-cac9-4c3f-946e-b4bcbc12ae05-0
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.520
Is it going up or down?

df24f67f-5012-40c5-9332-fd9371a3a53d-0
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.920
Down South?

8aab95b8-b7fa-4f39-b39b-2ab213a6d0cb-0
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.360
That means you're a bad manager.

b7616351-a2d0-4216-b765-b22395028246-0
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.728
Because after all, everything that you did in your life is in

b7616351-a2d0-4216-b765-b22395028246-1
00:03:32.728 --> 00:03:33.680
pursuit of happiness.

47d16643-7bda-4f87-bb08-5babc4a33dd3-0
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.720
Isn't it all that you're doing in your life?

0e9e92f8-1c47-41f1-ba47-90829febf689-0
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.040
You're doing it because you believe that is your happiness.

aa4c045a-ca07-4dde-9b9a-59fbb1a1e884-0
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.200
You educate yourself, you pursue careers.

648d0b63-f8bd-4169-8b7c-1b4a4df4b659-0
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.320
You build families.

d4a4eb11-34bf-444b-a064-6a20007af3bd-0
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.360
You run after your ambitions, sadhguru.

65f00976-0882-4968-9133-40967f556afa-0
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.522
So many things you do because somewhere you believe fulfilling

65f00976-0882-4968-9133-40967f556afa-1
00:03:50.522 --> 00:03:52.480
those things will bring you happiness.

b5fda21f-488b-40d0-bcf5-86c836710b2f-0
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.790
After doing all that, if happiness is not multiplying, it

b5fda21f-488b-40d0-bcf5-86c836710b2f-1
00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.840
is going down.

00d8fed0-834f-4414-a579-df0165b237c5-0
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.731
That means you are a bad manager of yourself, Anybody who does

00d8fed0-834f-4414-a579-df0165b237c5-1
00:04:04.731 --> 00:04:08.937
not know how to manage his own body, his own mind, his own

00d8fed0-834f-4414-a579-df0165b237c5-2
00:04:08.937 --> 00:04:10.720
emotion and his energies.

c4d06891-4717-49cc-a89e-805b8a22a8ce-0
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.312
If he is managing outside situations, he is only managing

c4d06891-4717-49cc-a89e-805b8a22a8ce-1
00:04:16.312 --> 00:04:19.960
them by accident, not by intent the way he wants it.

f203f017-9258-497f-83f7-98ddcde274bc-0
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.347
Because if you do not know how to manage your mind, how to

f203f017-9258-497f-83f7-98ddcde274bc-1
00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:27.594
manage your energies, how to manage your interiority,

f203f017-9258-497f-83f7-98ddcde274bc-2
00:04:27.594 --> 00:04:30.480
managing the outside is bound to be accidental.

654c326d-45a7-436e-89cf-c15ea3122b7d-0
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.297
When you manage situations by accident, you exist as an

654c326d-45a7-436e-89cf-c15ea3122b7d-1
00:04:36.297 --> 00:04:37.040
accident.

d87abaca-0c8c-4abb-85de-ea0ce7b3749d-0
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.680
When you exist as an accident, you are a potential calamity.

b9f49218-4f41-46b1-95bd-0c35231158c7-0
00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.271
When you exist as a potential calamity, being anxious all the

b9f49218-4f41-46b1-95bd-0c35231158c7-1
00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:53.641
time becomes a natural part of life anywhere you go Today,

b9f49218-4f41-46b1-95bd-0c35231158c7-2
00:04:53.641 --> 00:04:57.714
people are talking stress management, Especially a few

b9f49218-4f41-46b1-95bd-0c35231158c7-3
00:04:57.714 --> 00:05:02.231
years ago when I first went to
United States, wherever I go,

b9f49218-4f41-46b1-95bd-0c35231158c7-4
00:05:02.231 --> 00:05:05.120
people were talking stress management.

107dca11-3803-4909-80ba-b08a62714f0b-0
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:10.240
I could not understand why anybody wants to manage stress.

d9e4a78a-206a-423c-ae87-0cef2d846058-0
00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.532
Sadhguru can understand You want to manage your business, your

d9e4a78a-206a-423c-ae87-0cef2d846058-1
00:05:14.532 --> 00:05:16.840
finance, your family, your property, whatever.

0ded2933-561e-48cd-b6a7-c95c27ebfdfe-0
00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.320
But why would you want to manage stress?

eb9c5451-5921-4d90-b453-3312abd61d70-0
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.520
It took me a while to understand.

ad644ae4-ab11-4a80-b9d3-c8dbb63f4c8a-0
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.267
These people have come to the conclusion that there is no

ad644ae4-ab11-4a80-b9d3-c8dbb63f4c8a-1
00:05:25.267 --> 00:05:26.120
other way to live.

b2491bfc-53e1-4605-ae5e-e9304923f83c-0
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.812
Somehow people have come to the conclusion that if you do things

b2491bfc-53e1-4605-ae5e-e9304923f83c-1
00:05:30.812 --> 00:05:32.960
in the world, you're bound to be stressful.

fa09cc57-1824-4260-aaa1-85bd0225e0d7-0
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:37.680
One is not stressful because of what they're doing.

1001e1ab-f8bf-4fb1-9582-35f96d2f135d-0
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.880
One is stressful because he is a bad manager of himself.

a8cd6933-5499-4e2a-a7d3-fddd046c6bb6-0
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.880
He doesn't know how to manage his own systems.

9358d1ea-065a-40b5-961a-cace80ad8914-0
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.400
That is why he is stressful.

a2a58c9f-ed6e-4b06-a16b-6818474c38f7-0
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.560
It is not the nature of the job which makes 1 stressful.

d9306c5e-b2b5-457a-bf26-eb2e4ebd26dc-0
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.440
You ask a Chapparasi, he is also stressful.

06b2f7cc-52d7-40e0-a02c-1f19a6fa233e-0
00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.760
You ask the top executive, he is also stressful.

87b21fe9-cb10-44a8-a410-2869d3d1678f-0
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.640
Everybody believes their job is stressful.

5f66a914-e7f2-4931-a875-1b738a226a0a-0
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.640
No job is stressful.

69eec5c8-a69e-4007-811e-73ca8a868838-0
00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:03.855
If you have no control over your own systems, you will be

69eec5c8-a69e-4007-811e-73ca8a868838-1
00:06:03.855 --> 00:06:06.120
stressful whether you do something or you don't do

69eec5c8-a69e-4007-811e-73ca8a868838-2
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.520
anything.

192d0083-e9d6-4722-99e5-6b9dd5cda168-0
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:12.816
Isn't it So See, management means, fundamentally, management

192d0083-e9d6-4722-99e5-6b9dd5cda168-1
00:06:12.816 --> 00:06:18.080
means we want to decide the course of our destiny.

690dcaf7-3263-4e99-be0d-aff128bfb8a8-0
00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:19.960
That's management, isn't it?

c67f40d7-8a77-495e-8e25-f4fbc0befe1e-0
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.840
We don't want to live here by accident.

97386f45-02ec-4435-b528-3ec7ff4f2f49-0
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.520
We want to take our lives where we want to go.

151b6ef4-4f5c-4c3e-ba45-13df20517feb-0
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.040
That's management, isn't it?

60db5bd5-ecad-4bab-b835-2649e2316f8a-0
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.040
So if you're managing by accident, you are not a manager.

50a1174d-893c-4be5-89a7-f92a6c9ceec7-0
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.800
Without you, things will run better.

635c024c-e4d2-466f-9d1f-43af08fefc66-0
00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.380
So once you say I'm a manager, that means somewhere you have

635c024c-e4d2-466f-9d1f-43af08fefc66-1
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.160
decided that you want to go in a particular way.

634b0367-fba9-46fe-9030-790f798eccca-0
00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.977
You want to have a certain kind of situation, both inward and

634b0367-fba9-46fe-9030-790f798eccca-1
00:06:44.977 --> 00:06:45.320
outward.

293f58e1-0565-4b94-8667-e3414ea0f62a-0
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.814
So everybody is a manager in his own capacity, but in different

293f58e1-0565-4b94-8667-e3414ea0f62a-1
00:06:51.814 --> 00:06:53.880
levels and different types.

ad2a8e90-86d4-4686-8e08-bd297284fbef-0
00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.019
Whether you manage a kitchen where you cook for four people

ad2a8e90-86d4-4686-8e08-bd297284fbef-1
00:06:58.019 --> 00:07:01.458
or you manage a large industry where 10,000 people work,

ad2a8e90-86d4-4686-8e08-bd297284fbef-2
00:07:01.458 --> 00:07:05.078
fundamentally, if you want to have a good kitchen or a good

ad2a8e90-86d4-4686-8e08-bd297284fbef-3
00:07:05.078 --> 00:07:08.819
industry, you must be a good manager of that situation, isn't

ad2a8e90-86d4-4686-8e08-bd297284fbef-4
00:07:08.819 --> 00:07:09.000
it?

adaca0ca-ab92-48ef-bba5-79028f22a9ee-0
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.675
So whether you're managing a little kitchen or a large

adaca0ca-ab92-48ef-bba5-79028f22a9ee-1
00:07:13.675 --> 00:07:17.818
industry, if you want to manage outside situations, generally

adaca0ca-ab92-48ef-bba5-79028f22a9ee-2
00:07:17.818 --> 00:07:21.560
you will have to manage material and people around you.

032a1791-4294-428d-afcd-9453dfb4bb0e-0
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:26.235
If you have to manage 10 people or 10,000 people around you, you

032a1791-4294-428d-afcd-9453dfb4bb0e-1
00:07:26.235 --> 00:07:29.400
have to manage 10 minds or
10,000 minds around you.

1bda7646-309c-48b0-aaa8-fe16699d4aaf-0
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.570
But if you have no management over your own mind, you managing

1bda7646-309c-48b0-aaa8-fe16699d4aaf-1
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:40.981
10,000 minds is going to be a disaster in the process of doing

1bda7646-309c-48b0-aaa8-fe16699d4aaf-2
00:07:40.981 --> 00:07:41.839
something.

c24c880f-9188-44ee-8fdd-a4fc3a2bb3f4-0
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.671
If we are destroying human beings, which is happening right

c24c880f-9188-44ee-8fdd-a4fc3a2bb3f4-1
00:07:46.671 --> 00:07:51.241
now in the process of managing a situation, the man is broken,

c24c880f-9188-44ee-8fdd-a4fc3a2bb3f4-2
00:07:51.241 --> 00:07:55.593
then this kind of management is no good, because after all,

c24c880f-9188-44ee-8fdd-a4fc3a2bb3f4-3
00:07:55.593 --> 00:07:59.800
every management that we do is only for human well-being.

bc388651-b0bf-4b1d-9449-95b596758cdb-0
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:06.489
If we are doing management for human well-being in the process

bc388651-b0bf-4b1d-9449-95b596758cdb-1
00:08:06.489 --> 00:08:10.544
of doing something, in the process of managing situations,

bc388651-b0bf-4b1d-9449-95b596758cdb-2
00:08:10.544 --> 00:08:14.600
it is not only about producing something or making profit.

9a10b525-439e-43b2-a728-1cdf1b00f914-0
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.400
Human being should rise to their full potential.

3f71446d-8850-4e04-80f4-31ba805dfdce-0
00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.350
If we manage a situation properly, in simple process of

3f71446d-8850-4e04-80f4-31ba805dfdce-1
00:08:22.350 --> 00:08:26.210
working, you and the people who are working with you should be

3f71446d-8850-4e04-80f4-31ba805dfdce-2
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.600
able to raise to their full potential.

2e237ce5-d4c6-4d85-a043-f260bbd9618d-0
00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.540
Sadhguru when I say rising to full potential, not just worth

2e237ce5-d4c6-4d85-a043-f260bbd9618d-1
00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:37.140
potential, but as human beings they must be able to rise to

2e237ce5-d4c6-4d85-a043-f260bbd9618d-2
00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.400
their full potential.

3c934864-1350-47a4-b114-fefe644e7af8-0
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.553
If people work together, then people should be able to rise to

3c934864-1350-47a4-b114-fefe644e7af8-1
00:08:44.553 --> 00:08:49.040
the peak of their love, peace, compassion within themselves.

811e01c0-13c1-413f-bcb6-39cff2f4caed-0
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:54.488
If this doesn't happen, then it's bad management because all

811e01c0-13c1-413f-bcb6-39cff2f4caed-1
00:08:54.488 --> 00:08:58.200
management, the basic intent is human well-being.

4e337656-0f45-42be-bc72-d3c1761685c1-0
00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.200
That is not happening.

ddd0e3d6-f3aa-40b1-b1a4-76a9c7143add-0
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:04.637
You're just producing something, you're making little profit, but

ddd0e3d6-f3aa-40b1-b1a4-76a9c7143add-1
00:09:04.637 --> 00:09:07.720
human beings are getting broken in the process.

09914270-38d6-4ce7-86c6-76fe7830432b-0
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.400
It doesn't mean anything.

b3a15b44-65c3-4235-abc8-10216ab43b52-0
00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:14.180
So if this kind of management has to happen that just in

b3a15b44-65c3-4235-abc8-10216ab43b52-1
00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:18.858
managing a business you find people around you raise to their

b3a15b44-65c3-4235-abc8-10216ab43b52-2
00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:23.159
peak, then you have to spend a certain amount of time in

b3a15b44-65c3-4235-abc8-10216ab43b52-3
00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:25.800
focusing on your inner management.

04c6564d-f037-475e-9614-dae4acf9c883-0
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.960
If this doesn't happen will only manage situations by accident.

b7b84723-58e5-4741-9abd-2b1f0279bcf6-0
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.318
Lot of people have understood management as a way of throwing

b7b84723-58e5-4741-9abd-2b1f0279bcf6-1
00:09:35.318 --> 00:09:36.440
their weight around.

cdaa8f5a-a0df-499e-9bef-6cd7a5064c38-0
00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.440
Can I tell you a joke?

f746984a-23d9-4477-af37-bc011c2b97fc-0
00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.360
Are you OK Sadhguru?

31b685c0-fc0c-4a73-bcbe-6c4b75c89737-0
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:49.010
On a certain day a lion was really feeling great within

31b685c0-fc0c-4a73-bcbe-6c4b75c89737-1
00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:49.960
himself.

a48eaf2d-e061-461f-ba69-7555c3406991-0
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:56.400
He just was walking and a little rabbit was going.

7652a04d-26cc-473d-8184-56766f9ab32d-0
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.320
He caught him and roared at him.

d875d814-e6dc-4aa9-a07a-616528a42a38-0
00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.200
Who is the king of the jungle?

041fa26b-c49a-4401-b0cc-3662c631f9f1-0
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:03.200
The little rabbit.

8c67902d-b4b2-4f56-b9fa-01884df23df4-0
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.960
Terrified, said you.

bd999295-6637-403e-a949-8e544f6141af-0
00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.000
You, of course you.

2a276ad1-143c-4ef8-8098-160e07369cb3-0
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.080
He let him go.

c24a3d29-9f16-45d4-84d0-c6e6f80f7dcf-0
00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:10.040
Swaggered around a little bit.

8de7d32a-fbec-424b-b23e-a5b52e61a51f-0
00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:11.880
Then he found a fox.

4a080ac7-c61e-463f-a366-72f3d8ac74ab-0
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:12.440
Caught him.

15dae4cf-7801-4a0b-9cf5-1918a3c2ba1f-0
00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.160
Who is the king of the jungle?

5d67b924-7473-4f1e-b8ea-b05313ec570d-0
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.200
Oh, my Lord, it's you, of course.

044f7f9b-e3ea-4b4c-8155-94c55f024f02-0
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.280
Nobody else but you.

6defe09a-e2d0-48e2-b55c-0c3dff08be21-0
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.978
Then he swaggered or swaggered around a little bit, caught a

6defe09a-e2d0-48e2-b55c-0c3dff08be21-1
00:10:20.978 --> 00:10:21.720
few more animals.

371a6fc5-9706-4ba2-9953-fc464f297a9c-0
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.320
Everybody screamed out of fear.

13eff0b8-fed8-4282-8b26-6940d373b58c-0
00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:24.600
You are the king of the jungle.

303595e3-cf12-4bfc-88e9-a2f93e59900f-0
00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.880
Then he was in full swagger.

f76c612e-efb3-4c90-9962-b683c98e4bfc-0
00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:32.431
Sadhguru, like a manager king of the jungle, walked into a

f76c612e-efb3-4c90-9962-b683c98e4bfc-1
00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:34.440
clearing in the jungle.

fcde1650-a3d8-4197-8560-d32ff3f4dce0-0
00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.960
There there was a huge tusker standing.

da3bf7a9-4979-4e1d-9f84-5ad32e35360d-0
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.658
He went, stood in front of him and asked who is the king of the

da3bf7a9-4979-4e1d-9f84-5ad32e35360d-1
00:10:41.658 --> 00:10:42.080
jungle.

23425065-546b-4b16-8dd7-2f43c1158693-0
00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.771
The tusker took his trunk, rolled him up, picked him up,

23425065-546b-4b16-8dd7-2f43c1158693-1
00:10:46.771 --> 00:10:50.080
twirled him around, smashed him to the ground.

86424b83-96cc-4ccc-ab80-59f575517556-0
00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.160
His back broke.

d90fc8f8-5ff1-4577-9cff-2c0428d7175f-0
00:10:53.560 --> 00:11:01.509
Then the lion said you could have just told me, but the

d90fc8f8-5ff1-4577-9cff-2c0428d7175f-1
00:11:01.509 --> 00:11:08.040
tusker said, You see, I had to make my point.

dd4f187d-4427-4f8a-a513-11f09ebf6958-0
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.602
So lot of people generally are thinking management means just

dd4f187d-4427-4f8a-a513-11f09ebf6958-1
00:11:15.602 --> 00:11:17.680
throwing their weight around.

62c50865-369a-4a0c-aa95-dda225e7a8a4-0
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.800
Throwing your weight around is not management.

acbf997a-24c9-4560-8558-0a00dd0a5d8a-0
00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.120
Any fool can do that.

eaffad4e-7cd2-4d70-8fe0-46e3d314efc0-0
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.543
If you manage a situation, sadhguru, not just things

eaffad4e-7cd2-4d70-8fe0-46e3d314efc0-1
00:11:27.543 --> 00:11:31.581
happening there, people should feel elevated just being in that

eaffad4e-7cd2-4d70-8fe0-46e3d314efc0-2
00:11:31.581 --> 00:11:31.960
space.

b78617c2-a73b-4c83-b105-2818e32c2329-0
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.760
Otherwise it is not management.

3b55e6d6-8131-4341-8d8c-4a590c0bda3f-0
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:38.106
Above all, if you go to a place and you manage a situation, you

3b55e6d6-8131-4341-8d8c-4a590c0bda3f-1
00:11:38.106 --> 00:11:40.080
must feel wonderful being there.

985daf48-3ebe-479c-a235-d3093892f47e-0
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.800
If that doesn't happen, you are not a good manager.

88e795d9-f497-4400-9f87-b500973db1ec-0
00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.640
So if this has to happen, you need an inner dimension.

cc94586f-5759-46c3-a019-4f080f7f8023-0
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:55.000
When I say inner dimension, what is inner dimension, Sadhguru?

9d06681d-a482-48bd-9d40-8fc4845a93af-0
00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.360
When I say you know I'm not just talking about the body or the

9d06681d-a482-48bd-9d40-8fc4845a93af-1
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.720
mind because both this body and mind you gathered from outside

9d06681d-a482-48bd-9d40-8fc4845a93af-2
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.520
in certain ways, isn't it?

15e72094-4ae5-48c5-86f4-0c59c8d4af37-0
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.542
For example, this physical body, when you were a child, this body

15e72094-4ae5-48c5-86f4-0c59c8d4af37-1
00:12:11.542 --> 00:12:13.000
was only this much.

da41800d-61ec-41b3-9192-dd6b01c174df-0
00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.440
Now it's become this much.

4714f9e2-c998-44f3-9cd6-bd27bc31b2a7-0
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:16.840
How did this happen?

125aad78-fd63-4243-bb77-330f05c07b23-0
00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:20.720
How did this happen?

09c57b26-da97-42ec-9b27-b031feffc258-0
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:29.220
That's the question.

a7255efa-da29-4920-86ee-ded98f40e241-0
00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:33.100
How did this happen?

5bc28521-5ce0-4226-b2e4-da26c89408f7-0
00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:35.060
Hmm.

d31b72d3-847c-4476-ae56-b2d8d6ef161e-0
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.100
You grew up.

56a547d7-a2ff-4e14-acb2-ec8e0c9f78e9-0
00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:37.980
How did it happen?

44f745fa-3e95-4d80-95e4-869cc48d48a4-0
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:38.460
I'm asking.

e832ab01-4b1c-4bdc-be5c-4c2f0e3da438-0
00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:44.700
Hmm, I'm sorry.

d4477fb4-1c64-403a-a64e-615b1fc5b0e8-0
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.020
How did it happen?

da4efd09-9f30-47db-aa48-62694b4b9a6f-0
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:51.300
How did all this body happen?

8f9f65aa-21dd-4cec-91af-8484fd34db4b-0
00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.840
Food that you ate, isn't it?

e488cef0-e877-4bcc-ab83-9b0e32c5ef27-0
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.232
What you call as my body is actually a heap of food that you

e488cef0-e877-4bcc-ab83-9b0e32c5ef27-1
00:12:59.232 --> 00:12:59.680
gathered.

0ab10c29-b708-404a-99b8-6176f88cfee0-0
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.150
What you call as food is just a piece of earth that you convert

0ab10c29-b708-404a-99b8-6176f88cfee0-1
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.760
it into food and make it into body, isn't it?

7cb780e9-33e1-4bb1-ac04-8cad32058b3c-0
00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.465
So this body is just a heap of food that you gathered over a

7cb780e9-33e1-4bb1-ac04-8cad32058b3c-1
00:13:12.465 --> 00:13:13.200
period of time.

3927d178-af4e-4d9a-bdc3-2f483957278c-0
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:18.777
What you call as my mind is a heap of impressions that you

3927d178-af4e-4d9a-bdc3-2f483957278c-1
00:13:18.777 --> 00:13:21.120
gathered from outside Sadhguru.

af80e641-f940-4c61-8f0f-92fcd8a45154-0
00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:23.600
Now you have a heap of food and a heap of impressions.

6a3a6a10-a71c-4d81-a48d-5cdb7e205eda-0
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.170
If this much gathering has to happen, something more than this

6a3a6a10-a71c-4d81-a48d-5cdb7e205eda-1
00:13:29.170 --> 00:13:30.560
must exist, isn't it?

40a45267-db1b-416f-a243-4e855ef779d5-0
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.565
If you're capable of gathering such a large body and so much

40a45267-db1b-416f-a243-4e855ef779d5-1
00:13:35.565 --> 00:13:39.392
mind, there must be something more fundamental than this, But

40a45267-db1b-416f-a243-4e855ef779d5-2
00:13:39.392 --> 00:13:41.800
that never comes into your experience.

a82bd385-befc-4426-92bd-457eff1fad70-0
00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.939
You're just lost in these two heaps, trying to make some sense

a82bd385-befc-4426-92bd-457eff1fad70-1
00:13:45.939 --> 00:13:46.520
out of it.

c227962d-1f1d-4326-9167-93cc2d51a75d-0
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:52.462
Now as there is a science, as there is a management science

c227962d-1f1d-4326-9167-93cc2d51a75d-1
00:13:52.462 --> 00:13:56.476
for external well-being, there is a management for science for

c227962d-1f1d-4326-9167-93cc2d51a75d-2
00:13:56.476 --> 00:13:57.560
inner well-being.

57338cb8-14ba-4b23-a537-807ec3743376-0
00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.060
It is just that most of the time we have not approached it

57338cb8-14ba-4b23-a537-807ec3743376-1
00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:02.960
scientifically.

fd73ce67-4fa7-4005-8531-3719948ea60b-0
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.053
We're just believing by doing something somehow everything

fd73ce67-4fa7-4005-8531-3719948ea60b-1
00:14:07.053 --> 00:14:07.720
will be OK.

42359d8a-3dc2-4c92-9532-5eebe917b52f-0
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.314
Right now people are thinking by educating themselves they will

42359d8a-3dc2-4c92-9532-5eebe917b52f-1
00:14:13.314 --> 00:14:16.421
live happily ever after, which you will discover after some

42359d8a-3dc2-4c92-9532-5eebe917b52f-2
00:14:16.421 --> 00:14:16.679
time.

4112ae0a-2512-4507-b37b-a045d3d80e02-0
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.720
It's not so sadhguru.

f02d4930-e135-41c7-96bd-51ec8904ba0d-0
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.790
By getting a job they think they're going to be happy ever

f02d4930-e135-41c7-96bd-51ec8904ba0d-1
00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:25.068
after which you will discover it is not so by making money you

f02d4930-e135-41c7-96bd-51ec8904ba0d-2
00:14:25.068 --> 00:14:28.399
think you're going to be happy ever after, you will discover it

f02d4930-e135-41c7-96bd-51ec8904ba0d-3
00:14:28.399 --> 00:14:28.920
is not so.

59e10eb8-3047-4218-8a8f-2a3d73020174-0
00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:34.605
Somebody thinks by getting married they're going to be ever

59e10eb8-3047-4218-8a8f-2a3d73020174-1
00:14:34.605 --> 00:14:37.600
after and they know it is not so.

0e3845bd-a9a4-4e64-89ae-055b8d0c171d-0
00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.840
So you're trying to somehow fool yourself into Sadhguru,

0e3845bd-a9a4-4e64-89ae-055b8d0c171d-1
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.197
believing that by doing something, everything will be

0e3845bd-a9a4-4e64-89ae-055b8d0c171d-2
00:14:50.197 --> 00:14:50.440
OK.

c340775c-8e46-4eb1-8d82-e52f704ee2a7-0
00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:53.720
Though repeatedly it has let you down.

a97d4826-08b4-4480-b067-75d00db23ba7-0
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:56.744
Still, you believe that something else, some other

a97d4826-08b4-4480-b067-75d00db23ba7-1
00:14:56.744 --> 00:14:58.760
miracle, will make everything
OK.

2fde6caa-3fa5-4ab9-a469-c3afbbb453ca-0
00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:00.520
It'll not be OK.

ddffd267-b129-4728-ad08-76253896278f-0
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:07.622
It once happened on a certain day, a bull and a pheasant were

ddffd267-b129-4728-ad08-76253896278f-1
00:15:07.622 --> 00:15:09.840
grazing, grazing on the field.

9a66df9a-4252-4fe1-8c75-c8e2c3ebde13-0
00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.120
You know, a bull, a pheasant, A
bird, sadhguru.

88f090f1-3687-4b4c-a173-219fcd7c6343-0
00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.640
The bull was grazing on the grass.

19b59b10-6dbf-41ec-9e35-bca2fa14aab7-0
00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.498
The pheasant was picking ticks off the bull, their partners,

19b59b10-6dbf-41ec-9e35-bca2fa14aab7-1
00:15:18.498 --> 00:15:18.920
you know.

64b25522-e847-42c6-b57b-f1a8575b6b9c-0
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.269
Then the pheasant looked at a huge tree which was at the edge

64b25522-e847-42c6-b57b-f1a8575b6b9c-1
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:30.093
of the field and very nostalgically said, Alas, there

64b25522-e847-42c6-b57b-f1a8575b6b9c-2
00:15:30.093 --> 00:15:34.624
was a time when I could fly to the top most branch of the tree,

64b25522-e847-42c6-b57b-f1a8575b6b9c-3
00:15:34.624 --> 00:15:38.589
but today I do not have the strength even to fly to the

64b25522-e847-42c6-b57b-f1a8575b6b9c-4
00:15:38.589 --> 00:15:40.360
first branch of the tree.

845bd75c-6423-48b8-889d-df36fa29766b-0
00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.384
Sadhguru the bull very nonchalantly said, that's no

845bd75c-6423-48b8-889d-df36fa29766b-1
00:15:45.384 --> 00:15:48.360
problem, Eat a little bit of my dung every day.

1aea1a7b-7adf-438f-9d78-ede1a80a8ce2-0
00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:52.880
You will see within a fortnight's time you will reach

1aea1a7b-7adf-438f-9d78-ede1a80a8ce2-1
00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:55.400
the top of the tree, the pheasant said.

f869b208-e1bc-4c4b-8381-3abb715ca768-0
00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.880
Oh come off it, how is that possible?

bc13cf1a-d63c-45fa-acf9-ff938e2149da-0
00:15:59.040 --> 00:15:59.680
The bull said.

26c63c67-2a2d-45c1-acf3-bc57dc2ee03f-0
00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.200
Really, please try and see.

986e495d-8257-4077-b27d-0c8f226fc1f6-0
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:03.320
The whole humanity is on it.

a94a913a-392d-4787-a3db-95bf400e07f9-0
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.680
You could try to.

f64d07fc-68aa-47fe-99ca-9a1a2caad9bc-0
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.320
Very hesitantly, the pheasant started pecking at the dung and

f64d07fc-68aa-47fe-99ca-9a1a2caad9bc-1
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:17.571
low on the very first day it reached the first branch of the

f64d07fc-68aa-47fe-99ca-9a1a2caad9bc-2
00:16:17.571 --> 00:16:17.920
tree.

046ea2dd-01be-4369-9bf3-9778eeaf6ad6-0
00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:22.560
In a fortnight's time it reached the topmost branch of the tree.

1f3e8fb2-e0e9-412a-8cae-188783f3a510-0
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.893
It just went and sat on the topmost branch and justice

1f3e8fb2-e0e9-412a-8cae-188783f3a510-1
00:16:26.893 --> 00:16:28.840
looking at the scenery, enjoying it.

c9c672dc-c464-48f3-a4ce-e50af8d6ab93-0
00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.320
The old farmer saw a fat old pheasant on the top of the tree.

ab3d33d8-c81f-41cc-b1c8-a5ce6b379718-0
00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.040
He took out his shotgun and shot him off the tree.

6dd5ea08-f8a0-4f91-9f04-a77c5c53c167-0
00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.621
So the moral of the story is even ******** can get you to the

6dd5ea08-f8a0-4f91-9f04-a77c5c53c167-1
00:16:41.621 --> 00:16:43.960
top but never lets you stay there.

2e287650-c0c1-4084-ac7f-7977e57be571-0
00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:58.788
So if you are seeking, if you are seeking a life of

2e287650-c0c1-4084-ac7f-7977e57be571-1
00:16:58.788 --> 00:17:03.574
fulfillment, if you are seeking a life of joy and peace and

2e287650-c0c1-4084-ac7f-7977e57be571-2
00:17:03.574 --> 00:17:08.202
well-being within yourself, don't try to bull yourself in

2e287650-c0c1-4084-ac7f-7977e57be571-3
00:17:08.202 --> 00:17:08.920
some way.

10d3d3aa-2ede-4e06-8d15-4c00e8061c47-0
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.600
You must do the right thing, otherwise it won't work.

86dbf0e9-6cb7-457c-8a7f-be7bfae4ecd6-0
00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:18.160
Now that your managers are to be managers, Probably.

2157d132-91ab-435e-8fa8-e40741736c0f-0
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:18.760
Definitely.

87df22ab-9319-48e2-8632-918660c6c419-0
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.528
I hope they have taught you that unless you do the right thing,

87df22ab-9319-48e2-8632-918660c6c419-1
00:17:21.528 --> 00:17:23.000
it doesn't work with the outside.

5c9a5f7a-48fa-4f55-8a92-275f0b072ee5-0
00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.720
The same goes with the inside.

0213e3eb-ac2a-4eb2-b1bd-52a4999d4523-0
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.840
Unless you do the right thing, it just doesn't work.

cb0a7bfe-c02d-4b69-b98f-185dcdb78fe0-0
00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.110
You may just bull yourself to believe that this will make me

cb0a7bfe-c02d-4b69-b98f-185dcdb78fe0-1
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.680
all right.

9aed4e6f-9316-432d-b1df-ed774d342fc1-0
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.880
That will make me all right.

1b6f1143-d4ff-46db-a89e-e3449547900f-0
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.080
Yes, for a moment.

152883de-be05-4d2e-923f-5418f5a4b497-0
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.640
But the next moment you crash.

21646a43-0eb2-483e-abc5-0785ac67cc56-0
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:41.515
Please see successful people, unsuccessful people, just look

21646a43-0eb2-483e-abc5-0785ac67cc56-1
00:17:41.515 --> 00:17:46.431
at their lives and see in 24
hours how many moments are they

21646a43-0eb2-483e-abc5-0785ac67cc56-2
00:17:46.431 --> 00:17:47.560
really joyful.

2bc654c4-ac5e-413a-af6e-5752a57fa871-0
00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:50.680
How many you go on the street and see?

c737d4d6-b546-4bf5-9500-45da20ba9677-0
00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:53.640
How many joyful faces do you see on the street?

b3bdb79c-c75c-4b3f-af36-89adf0c79d3a-0
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:55.760
Very, very few, isn't it?

7524ace8-ddcf-4efc-8ef7-9d36fbfee0d0-0
00:17:55.760 --> 00:18:01.204
So yes, if you see any, usually they are young faces, over 30

7524ace8-ddcf-4efc-8ef7-9d36fbfee0d0-1
00:18:01.204 --> 00:18:03.400
faces are all long faces.

02f8ef57-46b8-467d-8b9d-0d74d199d99b-0
00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.000
What's happened to them?

794b3e1d-56de-4625-9ad2-e8553ee947d4-0
00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:08.887
For most of them, their lives have worked out far better than

794b3e1d-56de-4625-9ad2-e8553ee947d4-1
00:18:08.887 --> 00:18:09.760
they ever imagined.

84ae2688-3ed6-4c87-9482-5c478878275b-0
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.249
If you look at yourself as a generation, never before another

84ae2688-3ed6-4c87-9482-5c478878275b-1
00:18:14.249 --> 00:18:17.877
generation of people have been this comfortable and this well,

84ae2688-3ed6-4c87-9482-5c478878275b-2
00:18:17.877 --> 00:18:19.720
physically as you are right now.

a488df26-ffab-4b38-8156-10555e6e38de-0
00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:20.160
Isn't it?

1a56feb2-dba7-43a3-9f82-0f1232ac6eff-0
00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:21.360
Isn't it?

1c06264f-5146-46a9-bd7d-685dbebc771b-0
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.800
So we are the most comfortable generation.

bd4dfcbc-9159-4716-bb58-df08a4eddb4f-0
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.229
No other generation has known these kind of comforts and

bd4dfcbc-9159-4716-bb58-df08a4eddb4f-1
00:18:27.229 --> 00:18:27.920
conveniences.

3862519b-cbdc-4b59-bc66-af657ebd2ebe-0
00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.440
But still, are we any happier than what people were?

53b79d4f-6991-4fe2-8394-1086ee6b06d5-0
00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:37.072
This is simpler because we did not do inner management, we just

53b79d4f-6991-4fe2-8394-1086ee6b06d5-1
00:18:37.072 --> 00:18:38.720
did external management.

f589dfd4-85ab-4ac6-850a-479c08c3f0aa-0
00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.146
No inner management in the process of creating what we

f589dfd4-85ab-4ac6-850a-479c08c3f0aa-1
00:18:42.146 --> 00:18:44.200
want, the very source of our life.

8c3c56d4-680d-46b6-933b-644f4db9d702-0
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.080
This planet we're just destroying, isn't it?

757f3e08-cfe2-4418-afe6-9f76fe00ef1f-0
00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.304
In pursuit of our happiness, we are just making a bonfire out of

757f3e08-cfe2-4418-afe6-9f76fe00ef1f-1
00:18:52.304 --> 00:18:53.040
this planet.

ee93c445-56d3-43f4-adc4-c8ef0cca5fd7-0
00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.280
But still we are not satisfied.

78869ffb-b765-4bad-a50d-fd27492437ef-0
00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:59.976
Nor have are we any job more joyful than what we were 500

78869ffb-b765-4bad-a50d-fd27492437ef-1
00:18:59.976 --> 00:19:03.000
year people 500 years ago as people were.

cc6d84c9-2014-4505-8ca5-7d6c7978dd4e-0
00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:07.640
Isn't it so somewhere we have neglected the interiority.

ae13e712-4b89-4da0-ba06-5e0fe3f9b156-0
00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.960
So to turn inward what is needed?

2eb170ff-03c4-478c-bd54-09c0942bf516-0
00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:16.910
One reason why most young people here had never made any effort

2eb170ff-03c4-478c-bd54-09c0942bf516-1
00:19:16.910 --> 00:19:22.141
to turn inward is because today any thinking person, the moment

2eb170ff-03c4-478c-bd54-09c0942bf516-2
00:19:22.141 --> 00:19:27.290
he can read ABC, speak English and he has extra alphabets next

2eb170ff-03c4-478c-bd54-09c0942bf516-3
00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:31.622
to his name, he develops an allergy towards anything

2eb170ff-03c4-478c-bd54-09c0942bf516-4
00:19:31.622 --> 00:19:32.439
spiritual.

058c2cba-ef4c-4624-8fb6-d7399e7c70a4-0
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.560
Sadhguru, this is not your fault.

84586f8a-d4bb-426d-bbae-003fabb95a86-0
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:40.124
These so-called spiritual people have made such jokers out of

84586f8a-d4bb-426d-bbae-003fabb95a86-1
00:19:40.124 --> 00:19:40.920
themselves.

2a3662f6-1822-4f18-8a8d-0a8a3c46f003-0
00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.384
They have presented spirituality in such terrible ways,

2a3662f6-1822-4f18-8a8d-0a8a3c46f003-1
00:19:45.384 --> 00:19:49.372
ridiculous ways that anybody who has any sense doesn't want to go

2a3662f6-1822-4f18-8a8d-0a8a3c46f003-2
00:19:49.372 --> 00:19:50.400
anywhere near it.

f64afe84-d292-4dd9-8347-0b13721cc5c7-0
00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:57.668
See, a spirituality means to know something which is beyond

f64afe84-d292-4dd9-8347-0b13721cc5c7-1
00:19:57.668 --> 00:20:02.800
the physical right now if you exist as a physical entity.

7d5b9d92-18f8-4ca3-add9-9ed77bd3bbb3-0
00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.600
As a body, as a mind.

13a7c75c-7eec-4bc9-bed1-a690e89c37aa-0
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:10.440
Because both these things are accumulations from outside.

671eb97d-f3fe-4c13-b3d6-d01c4d13b033-0
00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:13.200
Whatever happens outside will happen inside.

6d8df87e-d456-469a-92cc-2d2100cc9842-0
00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:18.814
If what happens outside begins to happen within you all the

6d8df87e-d456-469a-92cc-2d2100cc9842-1
00:20:18.814 --> 00:20:23.139
time, then you being peaceful and happy is always accidental

6d8df87e-d456-469a-92cc-2d2100cc9842-2
00:20:23.139 --> 00:20:27.464
because it doesn't matter who you are, how powerful you are,

6d8df87e-d456-469a-92cc-2d2100cc9842-3
00:20:27.464 --> 00:20:31.647
how great a manager you are,
Sadhguru, external situations

6d8df87e-d456-469a-92cc-2d2100cc9842-4
00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:34.200
will never be 100% in your control.

f804770a-4d3f-4665-a0a7-8d502c2806bd-0
00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:35.800
That's the nature of the life.

9e42b149-ace9-441f-a092-4680c0e8cc51-0
00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:41.733
Even if you're just two people in the family, still you don't

9e42b149-ace9-441f-a092-4680c0e8cc51-1
00:20:41.733 --> 00:20:44.160
have absolute control over the situation, isn't it?

56b3c834-5ea5-4229-87f4-c734cae9b512-0
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:48.374
So as the scope and play of your life increases, you have less

56b3c834-5ea5-4229-87f4-c734cae9b512-1
00:20:48.374 --> 00:20:52.120
and less control over the situations in which you live.

026509f1-cb5b-424f-be44-e8f82bf08138-0
00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.880
That's the reality of life.

d9e61004-95be-468b-aa5e-ebc95a182aee-0
00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:58.159
So if whatever is happening outside is happening within you,

d9e61004-95be-468b-aa5e-ebc95a182aee-1
00:20:58.159 --> 00:21:02.000
you being peaceful and happy in your life is a far away thing.

0e4d76e8-e44a-4390-a5b9-2c79e5143529-0
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.080
It's never going to happen.

b1206e04-d461-49b2-99d7-48db480978de-0
00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:08.438
Only when a person begins to experience a dimension beyond

b1206e04-d461-49b2-99d7-48db480978de-1
00:21:08.438 --> 00:21:12.277
the physical within himself, then he can play with the

b1206e04-d461-49b2-99d7-48db480978de-2
00:21:12.277 --> 00:21:15.000
physical world whichever way he wants.

30f77b82-d401-4166-9480-34981d273737-0
00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:19.584
He can do the best that he can do with the outside world, but

30f77b82-d401-4166-9480-34981d273737-1
00:21:19.584 --> 00:21:23.480
the interiority is undisturbed, always the way you want it.

01be9c52-e58b-4595-9cd8-a20eb7a9d9c5-0
00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:28.520
The outside world will not happen the way we want it 100%.

6fb06394-ed26-4c1f-b9ab-3bd04e5e9291-0
00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.357
At least the inner world should happen the way we want it, isn't

6fb06394-ed26-4c1f-b9ab-3bd04e5e9291-1
00:21:32.357 --> 00:21:32.520
it?

cf2c100a-bdd8-4fb9-8bcf-6563dbbc55b5-0
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.040
So Isn't it?

0968a0c8-2e17-42db-8a7f-08c3a0ca8935-0
00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:40.200
So the outside will never happen
100% the way we want it.

2a7cd0d1-48b3-47da-b0e6-89eb6d2dca40-0
00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:41.960
That's the reality of life.

19963ac8-d412-4059-ade2-f3447ea83ac2-0
00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:45.240
But at least this one should happen the way we want it.

ee906364-8582-4b5a-ba22-4040193f411f-0
00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:48.848
If this is also not happening the way you want it, if your

ee906364-8582-4b5a-ba22-4040193f411f-1
00:21:48.848 --> 00:21:52.217
body, if your mind, if your emotions, if your energies are

ee906364-8582-4b5a-ba22-4040193f411f-2
00:21:52.217 --> 00:21:55.928
not functioning the way you want it, then this is the worst kind

ee906364-8582-4b5a-ba22-4040193f411f-3
00:21:55.928 --> 00:21:59.411
of slavery, because somebody else decides what should happen

ee906364-8582-4b5a-ba22-4040193f411f-4
00:21:59.411 --> 00:22:00.039
within you.

e764a2d8-f698-431c-a0d9-ec65df424493-0
00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:04.358
If somebody else decides what should happen around you, that

e764a2d8-f698-431c-a0d9-ec65df424493-1
00:22:04.358 --> 00:22:06.480
itself, you call it slavery, isn't it?

43c8fccf-ed64-491a-b540-e13b67827286-0
00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:10.480
So yes, are we in talking terms or no?

c8085690-c3ac-4eca-9b6b-edeb87e96467-0
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.320
OK, that's fine.

ba1cc0db-3507-4a36-ba31-4b95d56005a4-0
00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:17.964
If somebody decides what should happen around you that itself

ba1cc0db-3507-4a36-ba31-4b95d56005a4-1
00:22:17.964 --> 00:22:19.800
you call as slavery Sadhguru.

1f858a8c-3f62-430b-97a9-32444105c888-0
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.039
If someone decides what should happen within you, is it not a

1f858a8c-3f62-430b-97a9-32444105c888-1
00:22:23.039 --> 00:22:24.920
more horrible way of being a slave?

004660aa-7eb9-4136-a9d5-3a81102f72a0-0
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.520
But please see the whole world is in it.

338e7c84-8593-48bf-b889-cc7775701643-0
00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:38.520
The only consolation is everybody is like this now.

51d45806-a0cf-4900-a474-d060a35ab7bb-0
00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:42.457
Now that you're learning management as a science, I would

51d45806-a0cf-4900-a474-d060a35ab7bb-1
00:22:42.457 --> 00:22:46.131
like you to understand there is a whole science of inner

51d45806-a0cf-4900-a474-d060a35ab7bb-2
00:22:46.131 --> 00:22:46.840
management.

1d97a118-888d-47f7-bf4e-73bb16f7cf61-0
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:51.992
If you don't learn that, you may manage businesses, you may

1d97a118-888d-47f7-bf4e-73bb16f7cf61-1
00:22:51.992 --> 00:22:55.431
manage industry, but still you will not live a life of

1d97a118-888d-47f7-bf4e-73bb16f7cf61-2
00:22:55.431 --> 00:22:57.120
fulfillment and well-being.

740d7495-2b23-4ba9-8f3e-19aef931c923-0
00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:01.865
If you want to live a life of fulfillment and well-being and

740d7495-2b23-4ba9-8f3e-19aef931c923-1
00:23:01.865 --> 00:23:05.320
offer the same to people around you, it's extremely important.

e888d5fd-de41-43f6-a1cd-1260e0e68544-0
00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.920
You know what it means to manage your interiority.

85b9fe95-dc15-4e52-a209-827d10f20c49-0
00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.725
I I really don't know how you feel today, going out of

85b9fe95-dc15-4e52-a209-827d10f20c49-1
00:23:23.725 --> 00:23:29.138
probably the last step of your education, or at least one step

85b9fe95-dc15-4e52-a209-827d10f20c49-2
00:23:29.138 --> 00:23:33.520
of your education, a major step of your education.

c7b46526-0c46-4eab-a2d0-b813ef63b4ab-0
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:47.187
Because when I studied in the university, I was, I did not go

c7b46526-0c46-4eab-a2d0-b813ef63b4ab-1
00:23:47.187 --> 00:23:57.640
to my convocation somewhere right from my childhood.

3c50ef90-8eb0-4543-bb72-47146dd1ba0a-0
00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:06.760
Are you OK for a story right from my childhood.

aeacb3c3-8a28-4da2-a2cc-b7053042d41a-0
00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.720
The education that I received, though?

5e441e29-fa0a-4d11-859d-0131cad186b1-0
00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.040
They sent me to the best possible schools around.

eabc32e6-4501-49e0-91dd-623e7ceddbdf-0
00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:20.746
It didn't mean anything to me because my sense of listening

eabc32e6-4501-49e0-91dd-623e7ceddbdf-1
00:24:20.746 --> 00:24:23.240
and looking at people was such.

c1462b81-de27-43e3-8f0d-a31dded23f99-0
00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:31.167
When the teachers were talking, whatever chemistry, biology or

c1462b81-de27-43e3-8f0d-a31dded23f99-1
00:24:31.167 --> 00:24:36.248
mathematics, one thing I could clearly see was whatever they

c1462b81-de27-43e3-8f0d-a31dded23f99-2
00:24:36.248 --> 00:24:40.080
were saying didn't mean a damn thing to them.

ae4d65af-9f39-49e8-869a-e483a559de98-0
00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:47.725
And I was not willing to listen to anything from somebody who is

ae4d65af-9f39-49e8-869a-e483a559de98-1
00:24:47.725 --> 00:24:51.120
talking something which doesn't mean anything to him.

5e472849-4deb-4a03-b671-19b301074df5-0
00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.320
So I always looked at the teacher.

ac946780-957f-4a47-b1f3-a03f8e99e6e2-0
00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:03.200
If he put his heart into it, I'm willing to be there.

aef51ea6-b506-4feb-b512-879d8f2f9b9a-0
00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:09.741
Otherwise, I'm out because somewhere I'm I have so many

aef51ea6-b506-4feb-b512-879d8f2f9b9a-1
00:25:09.741 --> 00:25:12.840
things on my agenda for the day.

fe4f5f86-80f9-4d06-9f75-f02079238fbf-0
00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.320
24 hours are packed with too many things.

5562ae77-0c34-4dc3-b362-d0e7bf11616f-0
00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.290
I'm not willing to spend an hour or even 5 minutes listening to

5562ae77-0c34-4dc3-b362-d0e7bf11616f-1
00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:23.781
someone who is talking something which doesn't mean anything to

5562ae77-0c34-4dc3-b362-d0e7bf11616f-2
00:25:23.781 --> 00:25:24.000
him.

365f8121-95b5-4aef-b4b8-128f3440b269-0
00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:28.084
Even if he's talking nonsense, it doesn't matter if it means

365f8121-95b5-4aef-b4b8-128f3440b269-1
00:25:28.084 --> 00:25:30.400
something to him, I'm willing to listen to it.

b88a4516-02e5-4210-befe-69a09ba0bb56-0
00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:33.540
But if he's talking great things which don't mean anything to

b88a4516-02e5-4210-befe-69a09ba0bb56-1
00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:35.240
him, I'm not willing to listen to him.

b3221d0c-a650-44e9-87a3-cf07cd132c0b-0
00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:41.590
So as a part of this I spent your education is over so I can

b3221d0c-a650-44e9-87a3-cf07cd132c0b-1
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:42.000
talk.

fc0ea144-d4c0-4aa1-b3f6-c0d2cb1290be-0
00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:49.440
I spend almost 90% of my college hours outside, only 10% inside.

98a3c52f-dce4-4197-93b1-489294a1e98e-0
00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:54.471
Only when I saw somebody who is talking something with passion,

98a3c52f-dce4-4197-93b1-489294a1e98e-1
00:25:54.471 --> 00:25:55.120
I'm there.

5cfbabc3-390b-4b7a-8d00-f403cf6e0e4b-0
00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:57.440
Otherwise I'm just out.

a3822abe-5d0c-47d2-bb6e-6bc18c8fea50-0
00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:01.320
Now.

308f1128-e6bb-483e-aca0-f2fa78336f34-0
00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.000
This education.

2a63f506-603e-40d3-9195-e7736b248821-0
00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:08.967
I'm repeatedly telling Doctor,
Majumdar and few other people

2a63f506-603e-40d3-9195-e7736b248821-1
00:26:08.967 --> 00:26:12.921
around here, I'm happy to see somebody's talking with some

2a63f506-603e-40d3-9195-e7736b248821-2
00:26:12.921 --> 00:26:15.200
passion about what they're doing.

b4b6efca-8d64-4f6c-9384-c2400f224f10-0
00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:22.654
Somebody, it doesn't matter what they're doing is right, wrong,

b4b6efca-8d64-4f6c-9384-c2400f224f10-1
00:26:22.654 --> 00:26:27.240
OK, perfect or not, but someone has put his heart into it.

dbfda758-1971-4b4b-8c5d-54a3f090fa7d-0
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:30.853
It's OK because human lives becomes beautiful, not because

dbfda758-1971-4b4b-8c5d-54a3f090fa7d-1
00:26:30.853 --> 00:26:32.200
we do the right things.

6848915b-934b-4c57-bac6-9e8f067ad131-0
00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:36.238
Human lives become beautiful because we put our heart into

6848915b-934b-4c57-bac6-9e8f067ad131-1
00:26:36.238 --> 00:26:37.160
what we're doing.

4349d992-8965-413d-890d-52fe5da7a808-0
00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:41.590
It doesn't matter what we're doing, whether we're sweeping

4349d992-8965-413d-890d-52fe5da7a808-1
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:44.608
the floor or managing the country or what we're doing, if

4349d992-8965-413d-890d-52fe5da7a808-2
00:26:44.608 --> 00:26:47.886
we are putting our heart into what we're doing, it's beautiful

4349d992-8965-413d-890d-52fe5da7a808-3
00:26:47.886 --> 00:26:49.240
to be doing that activity.

26a8ce15-279f-4439-92d8-73bdfb7c5a07-0
00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:55.280
So I think it's a fortune that
I've just seen a few people.

773bcc32-5931-4bcf-a74f-28742a43f59c-0
00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.738
I hope everybody here is putting their hearts into what they're

773bcc32-5931-4bcf-a74f-28742a43f59c-1
00:26:59.738 --> 00:27:03.291
doing and living in an atmosphere where people are

773bcc32-5931-4bcf-a74f-28742a43f59c-2
00:27:03.291 --> 00:27:06.983
passionate about what they're doing itself is highly

773bcc32-5931-4bcf-a74f-28742a43f59c-3
00:27:06.983 --> 00:27:07.680
enriching.

79b9478d-848f-49a6-bc46-67bb54b29903-0
00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:13.027
Now that you're stepping into the world, not that you don't

79b9478d-848f-49a6-bc46-67bb54b29903-1
00:27:13.027 --> 00:27:16.301
know, but anyway, now you're stepping into the world in a

79b9478d-848f-49a6-bc46-67bb54b29903-2
00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:19.520
different dimension than the way you have been till now.

df58a5bd-3486-4614-86ad-ba9e40c8e3e3-0
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:23.390
Once you step into the world, there's going to be lot of

df58a5bd-3486-4614-86ad-ba9e40c8e3e3-1
00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:23.680
filth.

3198bb05-d5df-4d54-9ea9-bd907c82fc44-0
00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:28.669
There is corruption, there is nonsense, There is so many

3198bb05-d5df-4d54-9ea9-bd907c82fc44-1
00:27:28.669 --> 00:27:30.040
things happening everywhere.

31fea328-4795-478e-93f1-6d3084652271-0
00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:37.160
There are some set of people, a certain set of people, who will

31fea328-4795-478e-93f1-6d3084652271-1
00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.720
develop an allergy for this filth.

e5c6f7be-9fa1-4584-8e61-1464334e163a-0
00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.760
They can't stand it.

9ef09710-ba07-40ce-9e92-82ba5c562fd2-0
00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:48.657
They usually run to the
Himalayas because they're

9ef09710-ba07-40ce-9e92-82ba5c562fd2-1
00:27:48.657 --> 00:27:49.960
allergic to filth.

8b6e6e48-8fc4-44b4-8f0b-bad701b0ce7a-0
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:50.960
They can't take it.

57261053-cd4a-44c3-a8ac-911cfabe4207-0
00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.680
They want everything pure.

8f556ae8-fee1-4831-bd12-f3ad0761f549-0
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:59.760
But such a thing will not happen because the filth of the world

8f556ae8-fee1-4831-bd12-f3ad0761f549-1
00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:03.000
has one way or the other has entered our minds.

4c8d4e1c-e8e8-41c4-be2a-ce39470a9e53-0
00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.635
Sadhguru, whether we empower that filth or not is all the

4c8d4e1c-e8e8-41c4-be2a-ce39470a9e53-1
00:28:08.635 --> 00:28:11.280
option that we have, but we cannot avoid filth.

cea1c31d-c77c-4ac1-be54-7766d96c9568-0
00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.372
It is there, all the nonsense that can happen in the world,

cea1c31d-c77c-4ac1-be54-7766d96c9568-1
00:28:14.372 --> 00:28:16.000
you know in your head, isn't it?

fe1a94e3-4fd4-4bf1-97e1-cdb32290a3d5-0
00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:21.470
So one set of people develop allergy and try to run away,

fe1a94e3-4fd4-4bf1-97e1-cdb32290a3d5-1
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:23.240
which they can never do really.

8b16f0b1-7790-466c-9844-14122ac85618-0
00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:28.910
Another set of people, a large segment of people unfortunately

8b16f0b1-7790-466c-9844-14122ac85618-1
00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:32.160
have come to their own kind of philosophies.

52b2b2b0-c27e-443f-ab32-9afaec31d55c-0
00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:34.480
Anyway, there is world is full of filth.

6168c569-673d-44c1-aac3-0c82fdba0fb7-0
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.440
Let me also become filth.

78ba94da-b34f-4007-95bc-829f90e12d32-0
00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.240
So they have joined that.

d815363f-7277-4c34-94b5-8e535fc63ee1-0
00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:41.480
They have merged into the filth.

ec7dd721-c26e-405d-ab7e-cbcb3a4ae516-0
00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:49.880
What we call as filth can also be great manure.

8ad70b2a-e7a6-42c7-81b8-25c6e4f9893b-0
00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:55.214
You know Indian spirituality has always used Lotus as a

8ad70b2a-e7a6-42c7-81b8-25c6e4f9893b-1
00:28:55.214 --> 00:28:56.160
symbolism.

0e7d6641-3c1c-40de-8c3e-40262b268dd3-0
00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:01.537
A Lotus flower has always been the main symbolism for Indian

0e7d6641-3c1c-40de-8c3e-40262b268dd3-1
00:29:01.537 --> 00:29:02.360
spirituality.

043fb5e1-022b-4056-974f-7e08df5964f7-0
00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:07.570
Sadhguru, why A Lotus flower is a Lotus flower grows best where

043fb5e1-022b-4056-974f-7e08df5964f7-1
00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:08.880
the filth is thick.

05b8f71a-f52c-44cb-8122-6da770322742-0
00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:15.560
This filth which is stinking, which you can't bear, has

05b8f71a-f52c-44cb-8122-6da770322742-1
00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:19.320
transformed itself into your fragrant beautiful flower.

e3c52f80-2068-4e3c-89ac-565676c31314-0
00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:24.200
This option also is with us every moment of our life.

e57de508-35d5-407d-94fa-e8942ce775de-0
00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:33.729
If the atmospheres that we live in make us, we cannot call

e57de508-35d5-407d-94fa-e8942ce775de-1
00:29:33.729 --> 00:29:36.000
ourselves managers.

bedd2c71-5910-4347-a48e-f638ead2be0f-0
00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.696
If we make the atmospheres that we live in, only then we can

bedd2c71-5910-4347-a48e-f638ead2be0f-1
00:29:40.696 --> 00:29:42.040
call ourselves managers.

da0f6d8c-b547-4d4a-bb33-0ec6be305a3e-0
00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:48.405
Being a manager means that we are going to create whatever we

da0f6d8c-b547-4d4a-bb33-0ec6be305a3e-1
00:29:48.405 --> 00:29:52.480
see as the most beautiful thing to happen right now.

ce6765bf-d9c2-4b29-9347-ca558db84174-0
00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:57.320
Allowing situations to create you is not management at all.

7ebbe2c2-5330-4efb-a66e-439f427a18ee-0
00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:04.004
Creating the situations that we want is management, as many of

7ebbe2c2-5330-4efb-a66e-439f427a18ee-1
00:30:04.004 --> 00:30:06.560
them have said many things.

14cb185f-0567-4e74-9f5e-072ce9344d60-0
00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:17.794
This process of education, there is a certain exhilaration now

14cb185f-0567-4e74-9f5e-072ce9344d60-1
00:30:17.794 --> 00:30:20.480
that education is over.

54ee658c-e7b6-404f-9473-b7c744a683ca-0
00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:24.190
You're stepping into your new dimension of life, the

54ee658c-e7b6-404f-9473-b7c744a683ca-1
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:24.960
excitement.

4a4f6694-b205-4815-8833-1b403ddcc52e-0
00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:28.121
And you know, it's always beautiful to step into something

4a4f6694-b205-4815-8833-1b403ddcc52e-1
00:30:28.121 --> 00:30:30.480
new that you believe is going to be wonderful.

70eda6a2-cd15-4707-90d8-9a90e38b7547-0
00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:38.051
But what we have seen with life, with most people is now, let's

70eda6a2-cd15-4707-90d8-9a90e38b7547-1
00:30:38.051 --> 00:30:42.750
say somebody got a job the first day when they went and sat

70eda6a2-cd15-4707-90d8-9a90e38b7547-2
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:44.160
behind this table.

e9ae5320-d539-44da-b9da-d99a908b616a-0
00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.360
This table was the most fantastic place in the world.

de8fcc6d-b584-4057-ac3f-740c9fe6ec0e-0
00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.630
But within a few years, behind the same table, they are

de8fcc6d-b584-4057-ac3f-740c9fe6ec0e-1
00:30:53.630 --> 00:30:57.520
manufacturing blood pressure, diabetes, ulcers and whatnot.

ff618635-957a-491e-8c0b-9a7a9b4f124c-0
00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.661
This is not because there is something wrong with the jobs

ff618635-957a-491e-8c0b-9a7a9b4f124c-1
00:31:02.661 --> 00:31:03.120
that we do.

53af2d33-d9a8-4515-b848-82ee2f7e2843-0
00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.486
This is not because there is something wrong with the world

53af2d33-d9a8-4515-b848-82ee2f7e2843-1
00:31:06.486 --> 00:31:07.160
that we live in.

270979d7-5b76-4e19-a1f0-11cb45cd0d14-0
00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:12.790
It is simply because we have not paid sufficient attention to

270979d7-5b76-4e19-a1f0-11cb45cd0d14-1
00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:13.640
ourselves.

97346f5e-e03b-4871-b20b-61d617a09bb2-0
00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:19.986
We have paid too much attention to what is outside to succeed in

97346f5e-e03b-4871-b20b-61d617a09bb2-1
00:31:19.986 --> 00:31:20.920
the world.

a34c2512-f79f-4eae-acf8-650a103158db-0
00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:27.063
People are always thinking great aspirations will make you

a34c2512-f79f-4eae-acf8-650a103158db-1
00:31:27.063 --> 00:31:28.000
successful.

67069fa2-93bc-4508-b12e-74bfd701237e-0
00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:35.280
Aspiration is just an initial starting point.

2aae6360-bb74-4c2c-a5dd-70289912824c-0
00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:40.341
Just because you aspire for success, just because you aspire

2aae6360-bb74-4c2c-a5dd-70289912824c-1
00:31:40.341 --> 00:31:44.502
for prosperity, just because you aspire for well-being, it

2aae6360-bb74-4c2c-a5dd-70289912824c-2
00:31:44.502 --> 00:31:45.560
doesn't happen.

02d76bdd-6311-4230-914e-fdc748323935-0
00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:51.793
Success, prosperity, well-being happens because you have made

02d76bdd-6311-4230-914e-fdc748323935-1
00:31:51.793 --> 00:31:54.480
yourself capable of creating those things.

ed9285ee-a39d-4cfd-b6a9-24586f932f82-0
00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.400
Everybody aspires.

96a2be64-9c38-4a96-b549-f2fbf2994ad4-0
00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.400
Who is not aspiring for success in the world.

7bd7d4d6-2083-4786-8137-6ac141ef9ef0-0
00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.160
Everybody is aspiring.

1b2d9a45-a49f-4701-bfae-ac2c4458de10-0
00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.203
Even a beggar on the street is trying to be a successful

1b2d9a45-a49f-4701-bfae-ac2c4458de10-1
00:32:04.203 --> 00:32:05.040
beggar, isn't it?

2b83771d-94ee-4d86-be09-7c4d96c104d1-0
00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:11.680
So every human being is aspiring for it.

25118715-c741-4854-a643-4fdb671209a5-0
00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:16.080
But only those who have made themselves capable will succeed.

e546eb74-a6ea-4fb1-a073-354389cd088d-0
00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:21.936
Making yourself capable not only in terms of management skills

e546eb74-a6ea-4fb1-a073-354389cd088d-1
00:32:21.936 --> 00:32:25.040
and other things, but that is needed too.

5a29f4e9-c230-4a6c-8e64-dc02aea864fd-0
00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:29.769
But sadhguru, making yourself capable as a human being to go

5a29f4e9-c230-4a6c-8e64-dc02aea864fd-1
00:32:29.769 --> 00:32:34.562
through situations untouched, to be like a Lourdes flower, even

5a29f4e9-c230-4a6c-8e64-dc02aea864fd-2
00:32:34.562 --> 00:32:38.907
if you're in the filthiest of situations to maintain your

5a29f4e9-c230-4a6c-8e64-dc02aea864fd-3
00:32:38.907 --> 00:32:40.480
beauty and fragrance.

1b9e5eef-0289-407f-bc9c-29eed4f0665f-0
00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:45.280
If one has this, he will float through this life untouched.

dd2c74c5-86de-4760-b00b-787103b0c003-0
00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.960
If one doesn't have it, life will eat him up.

14c9ee1f-24f5-4527-ab5c-ef8a3aed0c9e-0
00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:56.972
In so many ways, it's my wish and my blessing that this new

14c9ee1f-24f5-4527-ab5c-ef8a3aed0c9e-1
00:32:56.972 --> 00:33:03.868
set of managers will manage this world, this country, this

14c9ee1f-24f5-4527-ab5c-ef8a3aed0c9e-2
00:33:03.868 --> 00:33:11.115
community, and the business and commerce which is part of our

14c9ee1f-24f5-4527-ab5c-ef8a3aed0c9e-3
00:33:11.115 --> 00:33:18.011
existence today in the world in a much better way than the

14c9ee1f-24f5-4527-ab5c-ef8a3aed0c9e-4
00:33:18.011 --> 00:33:22.920
previous generations of people have done.

0deb550d-ab32-4694-b27e-7bdb80834a2e-0
00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:28.000
Because externally we are better equipped than ever before.

45c668ee-557e-4de3-abf4-df9192bd02ed-0
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:33.552
If we make a little effort, it's it's a fortune that an

45c668ee-557e-4de3-abf4-df9192bd02ed-1
00:33:33.552 --> 00:33:37.895
institution has made an effort to equip you internally to

45c668ee-557e-4de3-abf4-df9192bd02ed-2
00:33:37.895 --> 00:33:41.040
whatever extent it was possible for them.

d13a5526-aed8-4694-92b5-8ce7f771f923-0
00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:46.471
If you equip equip yourself for internal management also, I'm

d13a5526-aed8-4694-92b5-8ce7f771f923-1
00:33:46.471 --> 00:33:50.757
sure that these group of people and many more who will pass out

d13a5526-aed8-4694-92b5-8ce7f771f923-2
00:33:50.757 --> 00:33:54.574
of this institution should definitely manage this world,

d13a5526-aed8-4694-92b5-8ce7f771f923-3
00:33:54.574 --> 00:33:58.792
this nation and the communities much, much better than the way

d13a5526-aed8-4694-92b5-8ce7f771f923-4
00:33:58.792 --> 00:34:00.400
it's been done till now.

0cea29f6-dec6-4e62-b20e-3b722c38be14-0
00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:06.808
When it comes to management, there's no such thing as perfect

0cea29f6-dec6-4e62-b20e-3b722c38be14-1
00:34:06.808 --> 00:34:07.640
management.

6454d3f5-e49b-4d51-9dfa-61bbf2217241-0
00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:13.135
It is just that if people give themselves absolutely to what

6454d3f5-e49b-4d51-9dfa-61bbf2217241-1
00:34:13.135 --> 00:34:15.600
they're doing, things will happen.

eacbb565-b2e6-4073-affc-1e436a43b113-0
00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:22.037
Right now, the Isha Foundation,
Doctor Karthikeyan, after seeing

eacbb565-b2e6-4073-affc-1e436a43b113-1
00:34:22.037 --> 00:34:26.480
what's happening there, that's how he's been into this.

effb8e13-8c1f-4f17-b768-90d8f13b3c53-0
00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:31.080
It is run by all young people, the whole foundation.

1eb501cd-cab5-43bc-9e47-04d45cc876b1-0
00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:36.680
We have hundreds of centers in
India and outside the country.

00aa5396-4a4f-4beb-95ba-a8992c02dded-0
00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:42.470
Everything is managed by very young people, people who have

00aa5396-4a4f-4beb-95ba-a8992c02dded-1
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:44.960
been with us for 14-15 years.

3ce66f83-19f0-47ec-a92c-42a63c8c9f5c-0
00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:51.200
They are just in their early 30s now, very, very young people.

96ff7c13-7525-4f81-ab9d-b27c0d8c06e1-0
00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:57.173
No senior people, no experienced people, just young people, raw

96ff7c13-7525-4f81-ab9d-b27c0d8c06e1-1
00:34:57.173 --> 00:34:57.640
hands.

7f45ece5-862c-4f71-9f36-9fabb1b74ea3-0
00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:03.294
I took this as a challenge to make it happen through them not

7f45ece5-862c-4f71-9f36-9fabb1b74ea3-1
00:35:03.294 --> 00:35:05.360
using any kind of experience.

e290d478-8af6-422b-a5e7-0a1f888babe0-0
00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.240
I'm not against experience, I'm not against that.

0b3af9fe-d432-4ca4-9a2d-1b1f9db82df7-0
00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:16.767
But I wanted to make a statement that incredible things can be

0b3af9fe-d432-4ca4-9a2d-1b1f9db82df7-1
00:35:16.767 --> 00:35:17.320
done.

f2a98875-5e16-4ebb-a312-e375b0d7e21e-0
00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.755
Not because we know how to do it, incredible things can be

f2a98875-5e16-4ebb-a312-e375b0d7e21e-1
00:35:20.755 --> 00:35:23.870
done simply because we're committed that it, we want it to

f2a98875-5e16-4ebb-a312-e375b0d7e21e-2
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:24.240
happen.

b71e8039-6f8b-4bff-9400-2f545a61b6cf-0
00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:24.760
That's all.

6fe60f16-a16f-4b1e-b021-f9cbbb0c8628-0
00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:31.627
Today this has grown into a voluntary organization with over

6fe60f16-a16f-4b1e-b021-f9cbbb0c8628-1
00:35:31.627 --> 00:35:36.738
200,000 active volunteers around the world, and we have taken

6fe60f16-a16f-4b1e-b021-f9cbbb0c8628-2
00:35:36.738 --> 00:35:40.200
enormous projects of social significance.

e38e6eba-f2d4-4357-b74c-e44684125d5e-0
00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:43.560
All these things are handled by volunteers.

a178eadb-d213-4da5-aed4-850610096a09-0
00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.160
They're not paid for it.

00fadb43-945b-4d94-a774-9a43297a22b5-0
00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:47.880
They spend from their own pockets and do things.

7204523d-e5b2-443a-ac8b-e4fef4399036-0
00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.120
You need to understand managing these people.

95aa1560-33ed-41ba-856f-7f5674557229-0
00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:56.776
Managing volunteers is much more difficult than managing paid

95aa1560-33ed-41ba-856f-7f5674557229-1
00:35:56.776 --> 00:35:59.680
employees because you can't fire them.

53180fdf-fac9-45b7-aaa2-2dfdd0629891-0
00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:06.052
You can never fire them for inefficiency or indiscipline or

53180fdf-fac9-45b7-aaa2-2dfdd0629891-1
00:36:06.052 --> 00:36:09.520
whatever because they are there on a voluntary basis.

3fa12707-6ccb-40ed-a6a3-1e66f30fb970-0
00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:14.344
So people who manage these situations, very young people

3fa12707-6ccb-40ed-a6a3-1e66f30fb970-1
00:36:14.344 --> 00:36:16.080
without any qualifications.

7299682b-9efa-44d1-9736-a1694d9daf2d-0
00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:20.855
They are such fantastic managers of people, the way they manage

7299682b-9efa-44d1-9736-a1694d9daf2d-1
00:36:20.855 --> 00:36:25.063
the situations, the way they conduct thousands of people has

7299682b-9efa-44d1-9736-a1694d9daf2d-2
00:36:25.063 --> 00:36:28.720
set such a exemplary example in the community there.

92fcf313-97ee-46a6-bc1c-c03b7e4c234e-0
00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:34.260
I would take this opportunity someday that when it's possible

92fcf313-97ee-46a6-bc1c-c03b7e4c234e-1
00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:38.880
you visit Isha Yoga centre as to how things are managed so simply

92fcf313-97ee-46a6-bc1c-c03b7e4c234e-2
00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.120
because management doesn't come.

2d416880-4e53-4738-862c-218db7b386f8-0
00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:44.576
I know you need to learn about finance, this, that banking and

2d416880-4e53-4738-862c-218db7b386f8-1
00:36:44.576 --> 00:36:46.120
those kind of things, Sadhguru.

c03954f5-092e-473c-b388-b6ee329b6543-0
00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:50.187
Fundamentally, management is your ability to be capable of

c03954f5-092e-473c-b388-b6ee329b6543-1
00:36:50.187 --> 00:36:52.600
inspiring people to do their best.

af9ab50b-0e50-4793-b74b-7d2281b5a279-0
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:54.840
And that's all we can do.

63975b97-abfe-40f3-9957-a0710aeee52f-0
00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:58.422
If everybody around us are doing their best, that's the best

63975b97-abfe-40f3-9957-a0710aeee52f-1
00:36:58.422 --> 00:37:00.280
possible management that can happen.

a3970abe-05d8-41ad-9a0f-79e54f8e9871-0
00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:04.200
So this is not going to come with manipulation.

8b53c7df-88b7-43a1-a99f-7a3740367054-0
00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:06.440
This is only going to come with dedication.

80fe166d-116f-42a4-8c4d-4f0351d556ad-0
00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.080
This is only going to come with love.

d4cf2102-db29-401e-98d8-d1280e443b28-0
00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:11.097
This is only going to come because you are willing to give

d4cf2102-db29-401e-98d8-d1280e443b28-1
00:37:11.097 --> 00:37:14.320
yourself 100% to the person who is next to you at that moment.

c032e5db-23e2-4caa-826d-676aece6f9a4-0
00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:16.640
Sadhguru, is all this possible?

fc3ac15c-7557-4ccc-a822-13bcf88cb1fe-0
00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.120
Is it not all utopian?

965874b9-1930-4cdf-a2e7-36100957b87f-0
00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.040
You think this is the reality in the corporate sector?

c696f2bc-8b16-4348-a4e2-0cf1eacd03a3-0
00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:26.785
I'm telling you, we are working in the prisons, we are working

c696f2bc-8b16-4348-a4e2-0cf1eacd03a3-1
00:37:26.785 --> 00:37:31.102
in rural areas, we are working with major corporations in the

c696f2bc-8b16-4348-a4e2-0cf1eacd03a3-2
00:37:31.102 --> 00:37:31.520
world.

67df8aa9-b544-474f-a207-4858971a5243-0
00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.720
It doesn't matter what kind of person you meet.

3e387c4c-1342-4572-95d0-51db096af161-0
00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:40.613
If you just learn to touch the core of his humanity then you

3e387c4c-1342-4572-95d0-51db096af161-1
00:37:40.613 --> 00:37:46.000
see every human being is willing to do his best for you always.

84607dd3-2f7c-44d3-b84a-a1dfd82ce6ac-0
00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.014
If you just learn how to touch the very core of a human being

84607dd3-2f7c-44d3-b84a-a1dfd82ce6ac-1
00:37:51.014 --> 00:37:55.288
who is around you right now, you will see everybody is willing to

84607dd3-2f7c-44d3-b84a-a1dfd82ce6ac-2
00:37:55.288 --> 00:37:57.360
do lay their lives down for you.

12c7257a-8e89-4353-a4cf-ab4538f9ce0e-0
00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.966
Only if people around you love you and they want to do the best

00:38:01.966 --> 00:38:05.000
for you, you will not get ulcers doing management.

00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:09.117
If people around you are trying to pull you down, you will

00:38:09.117 --> 00:38:09.440
anyway.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:17.214
So if you do not create the people who truly love us and

00:38:17.214 --> 00:38:21.896
wanting to give their best, then management is going to be a

00:38:21.896 --> 00:38:22.279
pain.

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:25.680
Management is going to be a huge suffering.

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:29.625
Only when people around us really want to do the best for

00:38:29.625 --> 00:38:29.840
you.

00:39:03.953 --> 00:39:06.280
way with inner technologies.

I've been to any number of colleges.

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:15.880
People are the same.

00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:21.294
But creating an institution with some sense of commitment for
